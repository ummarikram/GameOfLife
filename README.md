# John Conway's Game Of Life

## BACKGROUND

The game of life is a cellular automation devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a turing complete simulation that evolves based on certain rules.

## RULES

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## INSTRUCTIONS

* For using MySQL, you must create the database inside the "sql" folder on your local machine. Then change the username and password variables inside "bin/Storage/Databasehandler/DatabaseHandler.java" according to your machine.
